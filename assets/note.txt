Install this only once when setting up amplify cli for the new laptop
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

This following step needs to be setup once for each project
npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react


amplify pull --appId d393urn68kh4o --envName staging
I really don't like the "staging" but don't know how to fix it.


put the following in _app.js

import { ThemeProvider } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import { Amplify } from 'aws-amplify';

import awsconfig from './aws-exports';

import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css";
import { studioTheme } from "./ui-components";

Amplify.configure(awsconfig);

wrap app as following:

<ThemeProvider theme={studioTheme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>



To put this component in desired location
import {
 RaceCreateForm 
} from './ui-components';

<RaceCreateForm />
